# Hangman-Python-Game
Wanted to make a Python game as a beginner and thought Hangman would be fun to make.

Things to note:

1. Game generates 4-5 letter words
2. Only have 10 lives, but do not lose a life when your guess is right or invalid.
3. Script import from "wonderwords", so you might need that package before playing.
Do this my using "pip install wonderwords" in your python environment terminal.
4. Can only guess one letter or word at at a time. Doesn't allow multiple letters at one time.
5. Added Labels on the function in case you want to edit or give me tips.
6. HAVE FUN
